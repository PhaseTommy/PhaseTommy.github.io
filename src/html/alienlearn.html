                <p id="research-body-text"> This project aimed to establish communication between alien life and the
                    human race, a brief provided by the university. The problem that needed to be solved was the fact
                    that if we were to come into contact with alien life, we would have no way to communicate with them
                    unless they spoke our language. The application intends to bridge the gap in communication so that
                    each species can learn from each other. <br>
                    <br>
                    This meant that my research started with already established language applications, the obvious
                    place to start was Duolingo, a language application behemoth. Duolingo was studied meticulously and
                    had a moderate influence on a lot of the UI and UX choices throughout the application. Duolingo had
                    a large emphasis on icons and visual prompts as a form of navigation through the interface, this
                    makes a lot of sense in an app that may have issues with language barriers, visual icons and briefs
                    allow for a different form of communication to text and don't require language. <br>
                    <br>
                    My research and development studies also required extensive wireframing to deduce the best possible
                    user experience. My wireframes showed me an effective layout with large rectangular style components
                    that lead to primary actions, and effective navigation through the more complex areas of the
                    application.</p>

                    <p id="research-body-text"> The colour palette for this interface design was pivotal to its success
                        as an application. It is necessary for its success due to the application needing to be easily
                        legible and recognisable on all colours and backgrounds used throughout the design. The slightly
                        off white/greenish colour was perfect for outlining choices in a list, as it was subtle but
                        easily identifiable and fit the theme of the application (green).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The ironically named 'UFO Green' allowed the buttons primary calls to action to be reinforced by
                        the global knowledge of green meaning acceptance, allowing for the user to understand what they
                        are doing without the need to even read the text, should they not be able to for whatever
                        reason. The 'Charcoal' colour was effective in use in titles as it was dark enough to stand out
                        over other colours in the interface, but not too dark that it was daunting or harsh on the eyes.

                <p class="typeface-text" id="research-body-text"> Typeface choice was another carefully considered
                    factor of the design process. A well-selected type can determine the direction of the design, and
                    really complete or ruin a design (if done wrong). My typeface choice for this particular project is
                    one of my favourite and most used fonts in user interface design, 'Sofia Pro'.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sofia Pro is a great interface font as it is geometric, using perfect circles to achieve softness
                    and approachability. The geometric aspect of it allows the text to be easily read, an important
                    factor in a language application. Not only this, but it is also a largely versatile font,
                    effectively communicating at all different weight types, especially in its bold format; whilst also
                    looking effective capitalised with a larger kerning.
