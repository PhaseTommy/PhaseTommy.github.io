                <p id="research-body-text"> This project was birthed from my personal need for an application that
                    managed my time for me, had all my results and grades in one place (with feedback) and a place to
                    top up my balance on my university card on the go. <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst this project was done solely for fun, I still hope to develop it into a working application
                    in the future, as the premise behind the app is something that could be majorly beneficial to all
                    university students, which is also avoided by lots of universities.<br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of competitiors, the one I am most familiar with is Blackboard, which whilst boasting lots
                    of features fails to deliver on a mobile level, and at web level a lot of the time too. My negative
                    experiences with this software are the main reasons behind my desire to create such an application.

                    <p id="research-body-text"> The colours were essential to the feel of this design. University can be
                        a pretty lonely and depressing place, i didn't want this app to follow this trend. I used bright
                        light colours to give the app a welcoming feel and to make it visually interesting, working on
                        the premise that making something more visually appealing makes the task itself more appealing
                        to complete.

                        <br>
                        I especially like the 'Cadet Blue' which is ironically more green, it sets the tone for the main
                        components of the app; such as the navbar and hamburger menu and provides a great contrast to
                        the royal purple seen throughout the design.

                <p class="typeface-text" id="research-body-text"> Typeface choice was another carefully considered
                    factor of the design process. A well-selected type can determine the direction of the design, and
                    really complete or ruin a design (if done wrong). My typeface choice for this particular project is
                    one of my favourite and most used fonts in user interface design, 'Sofia Pro'.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sofia Pro is a great interface font as it is geometric, using perfect circles to achieve softness
                    and approachability. The geometric aspect of it allows the text to be easily read, an important
                    factor in a language application. Not only this, but it is also a largely versatile font,
                    effectively communicating at all different weight types, especially in its bold format; whilst also
                    looking effective capitalised with a larger kerning.
