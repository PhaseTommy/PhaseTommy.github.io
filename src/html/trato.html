                <p id="research-body-text"> The user interface design that I completed as part of a client project for
                    'Trato Contracts' was one of my most interesting projects to date. It was compelling project for
                    several reasons, it was software that I could see being useful for me perosnally in my day to day
                    work. This allowed me a fresh approach and to carefully consider, as a user, would be some of the
                    better user experience design choices. <br>
                    <br>
                    The application itself is a plugin for a contract management system that allows users to digitally
                    send/sign contracts to clients. My research started by looking at some similar applications such as
                    'Docusign' which is a similar premise, with limited features. Simple and beautiful user experience
                    was at the forefront of my brief, due to it being an already complex environment. <br>

                <div class="colour-palette-info">
                    <p id="research-body-text"> The colour palette was largely orchestrated by strict brand guidelines
                        and current branding. This however did not prove to be too much of an issue as it was an already
                        well thought out colour palette that allowed for some cool contrast with the orange and the dark
                        purples.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Using the 'Princeton Orange' as an accent colour made the piece feel very recognisable as a
                        Trato product, whilst also adding significant depth to the feel of the design, without being too
                        offensive/bright. Similarly, it worked effectively in both the light and dark themes seen
                        throughout the software.
                        <br>

            <h1>Typeface</h1>
            <div class="typeface-image-wrapper">
                <img src="/src/images/Helvetica.svg">
                <p class="typeface-text" id="research-body-text"> Similarly to the colour palette, typeface choice had
                    to adhere to the brand guidelines, which uses 'Helvetica'. I find Helvetica to be an interesting
                    font to work with as it is not always the easiest to style into an interface design, as it can
                    appear generic and unappealing. This is where I believe the colour palette aided the typeface in
                    standing out and stopped it from appearing repititive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite how 'generic' a font it might be it is certainly effective in communicating with the user,
                    as a popular font it can feel natural to the user and allow them to more easily communicate with the
                    design due to its natural flow.
