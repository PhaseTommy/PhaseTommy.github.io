                <p id="research-body-text"> The approach to the user interface for Phase took careful planning and
                    extensive research to reach the best design solution. It is a very specific product, and as such,
                    the design philosophy must cohere with the users' needs. User engagement and success within the
                    application is pivotal to design orientation. <br>
                    <br>
                    My research started looking at competition and what they have done to create a successful product
                    with a satisfied and engaging community of users, that all contribute to success. A heavy emphasis
                    on community collaboration puts even more emphasis on the user experience being thoroughly enjoyable
                    and easy to use. <br>
                    <br>
                    The complexity of the application means that it is easy for the design to become crowded and
                    confusing, something that is important to avoid for good user experience. This is why I created
                    clear sections in the design demonstrated with visual elements, it breaks up the complexity and
                    allows the user to easily digest the relevant information. </p>

                        The colour palette was determined by the clients' request for a dark theme. Dark themes can be
                        interesting and visually unique, but they also come with limitations and things to consider;
                        such as difficulty reading non-primary text elements, due to contrast issues. A darker tone can
                        cause certain elements to get washed out in the design, such as buttons and other important
                        elements.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To compensate for the issues that can be had with a dark theme, I decided to use a blend of dark
                        and light themes to create an interesting balance between colours that allow for easy viewing
                        and accessibility.

                <p class="typeface-text" id="research-body-text"> Typeface choice was another carefully deliberated
                    factor that took significant thought and usability testing. Initially, I wanted a typeface that was
                    unique but still included the necessary components of modern interface design.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Proxima Nova turned out to be the perfect choice for this interface as it has lots of visual quirks
                    in varying stroke sizes on curved letters, whilst maintaining legibility and that classic modern
                    interface typeface look. It was also important that it fits well with other fonts used throughout
                    the website, and due to its excellent versatility, they can work in unison without looking out of
                    place or neglected.
